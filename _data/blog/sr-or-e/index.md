I have to choose between two companies, very different in many aspects. I wrote my ongoing thoughts to make a decision.

## Location: US or Korea?

In terms of software engineering, I think the US has always been the center and the leading country in software. It has some of the biggest tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and many more. And the name Silicon Valley attracts top engineers from around the world. However, in Korea, although software engineers are in high demand, they are not as well paid or well treated as in the US. I prefer the US over Korea in this sense because the advantages coming from the location is undeniable. But Korea has its own merits. I have friends, family, and girlfriend here.

## Work: Software Engineering or Research (generalist or specialist)?

The nature of the work that I'll be doing will be very different depending on where I end up. If I end up at E, I will acquire a broad range of skillsets as a full stack engineer. If I end up at SR, I will become specialized in a narrow field such as on-device AI, AR, and so on. What kind of work do I prefer? Do I want to be a software engineer or a researcher? Do I want to touch on a broad range of technologies / areas, or do I want to focus on a certain thing and become expert in it?

## Name value / Career advantage

What would be more helpful in future recruiting? Working at E or working at SR? I think if I work at E, I will have skill sets that are in high demand from a larger job market. If I work at SR, I will become good at a narrow field with fewer number of experts but a smaller job market will be in demand of me.

## Relationship

If I go to E, it is going to be hard to maintain a relationship with my girlfriend. Not saying it's impossible, but it will be hard. I will probably see her only a few times a year. And I don't know how long that would last.

## Stability

The CEO at E said "After one year of employment in good standing, we will consider you for an H1B visa sponsorship." It's a bit risky, I'd say. But with STEM OPT extension, I have at least three years. Three years is a long time. And there is always a risk in any choices, even the seemingly safest one.

## People

Although I haven't talked to many people at E, the people I met during my interviews seemed very knowledgable and kind. People I met at SR are also nice, but there didn't seem to be a lot of collaboration going on. Everyone seemed to be buried in their own work. There didn't seem to be a lot of discussion going on. But I also heard it varies a lot from lab to lab.

## Reviews / Testimonials from employees

E has excellent Glassdoor reviews. People there seem to really love the company. They commonly say you need a lot of autonomy and self-management to thrive in E. Am I that kind of person? Or am I the person in need of tight management?

I talked to few people at SR. Their common feedback was overall negative with a glimpse of hope.

* The management does not like employees to do actual research or publish a paper.
* There is not much product development going on. It's often to show the leaders what they've achieved throughout the year, rather than producing an actual service. The latter requires serious software engineering, but the former only requires "making it work".
* Only a few labs (10% of the labs) seem to be good. They are doing some cool stuff, but most of the labs aren't very good. Rather than trying out new things, people prefer stability because they have a family. In few years, you will become stagnated. But if you can get to the good lab, that should be also good.
